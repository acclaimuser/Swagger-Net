Seamlessly add [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) to WebApi projects! Combines ApiExplorer and Swagger/swagger-ui(3.x) to provide a rich discovery, documentation and playground experience to your API consumers.

In addition to its Swagger generator, the [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) is embedded and will automatically serve up once Swagger-Net is installed. This means you can complement your API with a slick discovery UI to assist consumers with their integration efforts.
